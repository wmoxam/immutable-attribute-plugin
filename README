EnsuresImmutabilityOf
=====================

There are many cases where a model attribute should not be changed once it's set. This plugin makes it dead simple.


Example
=======

class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  ensures_immutability_of :username
end

account = Account.create(:username => 'jgreen')
...
account.update(:username => 'jgreen')  # raises RuntimeError
